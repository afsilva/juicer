## What is Juicer?

Juicer is a collection of tools for administering Pulp [1], a Fedora
Hosted Project for managing yum repositories, from a release
engineering point of view. Pulp allows you to remotely manage
repositories in multiple environments such as QA, STAGE, or PROD as
well as upload and promote rpm packages through a Pulp installation.
