# Juicer

## What is Juicer?

From a Release Engineering point of view, Juicer is a collection of
tools for administering Pulp [1], a Fedora Hosted Project for managing
yum repositories.

Juicer allows you to remotely manage repositories in multiple
environments such as QA, STAGE, or PROD as well as upload and promote
rpm packages through a Pulp installation.
