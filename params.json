[Installation](https://github.com/juicer/juicer/blob/master/docs/markdown/install.md)\r\n2. [Configuration](https://github.com/juicer/juicer/blob/master/docs/markdown/config.md)\r\n3. [Hacking](https://github.com/juicer/juicer/blob/master/docs/markdown/hacking.md)\r\n4. [RpmSignPlugins](https://github.com/juicer/juicer/blob/master/docs/markdown/plugins.md)\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Prepare Pulp for use with Juicer\r\n\r\nOut of the box, Pulp servers are not _quite_ ready to work with Juicer. There's really only two things left to do. First, you need to decide on how many Pulp environments you're going to have. At least three (dev, qa, and prod) is recommended. Then, configure Juicer to use them.\r\n\r\n    $ man juicer.conf\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, all that's left to do is to create the backend repositories that Juicer needs. Because we're so thoughtful (and lazy!) we've made this part really easy:\r\n\r\n    $ juicer-admin setup\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to start creating release carts!\r\n\r\n### Upload an rpm into a repository\r\n\r\n    $ juicer upload -r juicy-software ~/Downloads/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm\r\n\r\n### Example Workflow\r\n\r\nStart by creating a release cart `MyJuicyRelease` with items from the Internet:\r\n\r\n    $ juicer create MyJuicyRelease -r juicy-software https://my.sweet.host/pulp/repos/dev/juicy-software/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm\r\n\r\nThen push the cart and its contents to pulp:\r\n\r\n    $ juicer push MyJuicyRelease\r\n\r\nWhen you're satisfied, promote the cart to the next environment\r\n(perhaps `stage`, or `production`):\r\n\r\n    $ juicer promote MyJuicyRelease\r\n"}
