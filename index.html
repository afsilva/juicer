<h2>What is Juicer?</h2>

<p>From a Release Engineering point of view, Juicer is a collection of
tools for administering Pulp [1], a Fedora Hosted Project for managing
yum repositories.</p>

<p>Juicer allows you to remotely manage repositories in multiple
environments such as QA, STAGE, or PROD as well as upload and promote
rpm packages through a Pulp installation.</p>

<h3>Prepare Pulp for use with Juicer</h3>

<p>We assume that you have Pulp running already. Pulp ships with a default user whose name and password are both admin. If you've changed that, it's fine. If not, Juicer provides an easy way to do so! Either way, put your account credentials in your juicer.conf. There's really only two things left to configure Pulp for use with Juicer.</p>

<p>First, you need to decide on how many Pulp environments you're going to have. At least three (dev, qa, and prod) is recommended. Then, configure Juicer to use them.</p>

<pre><code>$ man juicer.conf
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, all that's left to do is to create the backend repositories that Juicer needs. Because we're so thoughtful (and lazy!) we've made this part really easy:</p>

<pre><code>$ juicer-admin setup
</code></pre>

<p>Now you're ready to start creating release carts!</p>

<h3>Upload an rpm into a repository</h3>

<pre><code>$ juicer upload -r juicy-software ~/Downloads/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>

<h3>Example Workflow</h3>

<p>Start by creating a release cart <code>MyJuicyRelease</code> with items from the Internet:</p>

<pre><code>$ juicer create MyJuicyRelease -r juicy-software https://my.sweet.host/pulp/repos/dev/juicy-software/juicer-0.1.7-1.fc17.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>Then push the cart and its contents to pulp:</p>

<pre><code>$ juicer push MyJuicyRelease
</code></pre>

<p>When you're satisfied, promote the cart to the next environment
(perhaps <code>stage</code>, or <code>production</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ juicer promote MyJuicyRelease
</code></pre>
