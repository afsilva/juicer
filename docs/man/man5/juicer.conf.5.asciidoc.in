NAME
----
juicer.conf - juicer configuration file


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Sections and variables to use in your juicer configuration file. This
file is broken into two or more parts. The first is *DEFAULT* and the
rest are named after your environments, e.g., __qa__, __stage__, or
__prod__.

Assuming you have a __devel__ and __prod__ environment, you might have
a configuration file that looks like this:

[literal]
    # ~/.juicer.conf - In this example config file we maintain two
    # environments: devel and prod.

    [DEFAULT]
    username: tux
    password: 5w33tP@ssw04d
    base_url: https://pulp.devel.int.tux.org/pulp/api

    [devel]
    # Most of our configuration for this environment lives in the
    # DEFAULT section already, but we do need to tell Juicer where
    # this environment promotes to next.
    promotes_to: prod

    # This is the base environment. This means juicer will default to
    # using 'devel' when commands are not specified with an explicit
    # environment(s).
    base

    [prod]
    # username already defined in DEFAULT.
    password: 5w33t_AdM!n_P@ssw04d

    # Note that this is a different pulp server, so we must specify
    the base_url once again.
    base_url: https://pulp.prod.int.tux.org/pulp/api

    # We specify that the production environment requires packages to
    # be signed.
    requires_signature
